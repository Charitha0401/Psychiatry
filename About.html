    <h2>Charitha Nallaka</h2>
    <p>I am Charitha Nallaka, currently pursuing my Master's in Applied Statistics and Data Science at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). My passion for understanding mental health through data analysis led me to the "Logic of Psychiatry" project under the guidance of Professor Ogan. This project aims to develop a comprehensive database of logical structures for DSM-5 conditions, using mathematical techniques to identify patterns and create visualizations that enhance our understanding of these disorders. I have specifically worked on Anxiety Disorders, where I was responsible for collecting data and constructing circuit diagrams for all anxiety disorders. The project has been both challenging and rewarding, involving the extraction and organization of complex diagnostic criteria, the design of accurate logic circuits, and the integration of user-friendly technology. These experiences have honed my skills in data preprocessing, logic circuit design, web development, and effective communication. This work aligns with my aspiration to contribute to mental health research and clinical practice through innovative data-driven solutions. I am grateful to Professor Ogan, my peers, and mentors for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this journey.</p>

    <h2>Sai Krishna Nandyala</h2>
    <p>I am Sai Krishna Nandyala, currently contributing to the "Logic of Psychiatry" project with a focus on mood disorders. My role involves collecting data and constructing circuit diagrams that are useful for psychiatrists in diagnosing and understanding mood disorders. By leveraging data analysis and implementing complex logic circuits using adders and comparators, I aim to accurately represent the diagnostic criteria for these conditions. This work enhances our ability to visualize and interpret mood-related disorders, ultimately contributing to improved mental health outcomes. I am committed to advancing mental health research and clinical practice through innovative, data-driven solutions. I am grateful for the guidance and support from Professor Ogan, my peers, and mentors throughout this journey.</p>

    <h2>Rajamanohor Vadrevu</h2>
    <p>I am Rajamanohor Vadrevu, specializing in thought disorders within the "Logic of Psychiatry" project. My role involves the intricate task of collecting data and constructing circuit diagrams tailored for thought disorders, providing valuable tools for psychiatrists. Through the application of advanced statistical methods, I aim to uncover patterns and insights that enhance our understanding of thought-related conditions. This detailed approach not only facilitates accurate visualization and interpretation but also supports more effective clinical practices. My dedication to this project stems from a commitment to improving mental health research and clinical outcomes through innovative data-driven solutions. I am grateful for the invaluable guidance and support from Professor Ogan, as well as the collaboration with my peers and mentors.</p>
