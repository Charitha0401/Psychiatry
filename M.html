    <h1>Mood Disorders</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Mood disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by significant disturbances in a personâ€™s emotional state. These disorders can result in extreme changes in mood, energy, and functionality. The two most common types of mood disorders are major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Mood disorders can disrupt daily life and impact relationships, work, and overall well-being.</p>
    
    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Mood disorders differ from normal mood fluctuations by their severity and duration. Individuals with mood disorders may experience prolonged periods of sadness, hopelessness, or emotional highs (mania). Symptoms can interfere with daily functioning and often require clinical intervention. The duration and intensity of symptoms help distinguish mood disorders from transient emotional states related to life stressors.</p>
    
    <h2>Specific Disorders</h2>
    <p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness or a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities. Symptoms must last for at least two weeks and may include changes in appetite, sleep disturbances, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts.</p>
    
    <p>Bipolar Disorder involves episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs. Manic episodes may include elevated mood, increased energy, and impulsivity, while depressive episodes share characteristics with MDD. Bipolar disorder is classified into Bipolar I (at least one manic episode) and Bipolar II (at least one major depressive episode and one hypomanic episode).</p>
    
    <p>Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) is a chronic form of depression lasting for at least two years in adults (one year in children and adolescents). Symptoms are generally less severe than those of major depression but can significantly impair functioning.</p>
    
    <p>Cyclothymic Disorder involves periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least two years in adults (one year in children and adolescents). Symptoms are less severe than those of bipolar disorder and may not meet the criteria for a specific mood episode.</p>
    
    <p>Substance-Induced Mood Disorder occurs when mood disturbances are caused by the direct physiological effects of a substance, such as drug use or withdrawal. Symptoms can include depressive or manic episodes that occur during or after substance use.</p>
    
    <p>Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition refers to mood symptoms that arise as a direct consequence of a medical condition, such as a thyroid disorder or neurological condition.</p>
    
    <p>Assessment of mood disorders typically includes a comprehensive clinical evaluation, interviews, and standardized questionnaires to determine the severity and impact of symptoms. Treatment may involve psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and lifestyle changes to improve mood regulation and overall well-being.</p>
    
    <p>Individuals with mood disorders are at an increased risk for self-harm or suicidal behavior, emphasizing the importance of early identification and effective treatment strategies to improve outcomes.</p>
